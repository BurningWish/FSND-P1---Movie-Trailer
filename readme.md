A mini project that let you build a movie trailer website on your desktop (example as the following picture). The website will introduce you my favourite movie series - star wars.

By clicking a movie poster, you will see its youtube trailer video. So enjoy it and have fun!

## Code Usage

- first download the repository to your desktop.
- move to the folder you just downloaded and unzipped, and run ```python my_ent_center.py``` in your terminal, and you will generate the movie trailer website in the same folder, that's it!
- Alternatively, you can simply open ```my_ent_center.py``` in your own Python IDE (such as Spyder or Pycharm) and run this script.
